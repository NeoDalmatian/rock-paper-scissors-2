Rock Paper Scissors Game

I wrote this code to demonstrate my beginner level of knowledge with JavaScript. The code uses variables, functions, loops, and other basic concepts to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played in the console.

The game works by prompting the player to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and then randomly generating the computer's choice. The two choices are then compared to determine the winner of the round. The game is played for five rounds, and the player's and computer's scores are tracked. At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed and the game can be reset to play again.

Overall, this code demonstrates my understanding of basic programming concepts in JavaScript and my ability to use them to create a functional program.
